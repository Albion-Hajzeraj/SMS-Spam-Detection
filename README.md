# SMS Spam Detection

## Overview

This project focuses on building an SMS Spam Detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify text messages as **spam** or **ham (legitimate)** by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and supervised learning models.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas & NumPy** – data handling
* **Scikit-learn** – machine learning models
* **NLTK / Regex** – text preprocessing

## Dataset

The dataset contains labeled SMS messages categorized as spam or ham. It is used to train and evaluate the classification model.

## Project Workflow

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Text preprocessing (lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal)
3. Feature extraction (Bag of Words / TF-IDF)
4. Model training and testing
5. Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)

## Model

A machine learning classification model is trained to detect spam messages. The model learns patterns commonly found in spam texts and applies them to unseen messages.

## Results

The model achieves strong performance in identifying spam messages while minimizing false positives, making it suitable for real-world SMS filtering tasks.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook
4. Run the cells sequentially

## Use Case

This project demonstrates practical applications of NLP and machine learning and is suitable for showcasing skills in **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, or **Junior Data roles**.
